Gem
===

Project for solving the Fifteen or "Gem" puzzle.

The code to model the problem and solve it two ways is in Haskell in the src directory. The build produces a number of binaries that are able to solve puzzles in various ways, run the tests, and output demos for the HTML demonstration page.

There is a demonstration board showing some of the techniques in the web directory. An HTML file and some JavaScript power the display.

This is completely useless to anyone and was done for no good reason.
